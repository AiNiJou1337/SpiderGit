      "description": "Visual impairment can pose a challenge to accomplish everyday activities such as driving, reading, and walking. People with visual impairment experience their surroundings uniquely when compared to a sighted person. They have more active senses (touch, smell, sound, and taste) to learn about their surrounding but activity as easy as reading a book or detecting objects in front without touching seems impossible for them. Drishti (meaning \"vision\" in the Hindi language) is designed to describe this beautiful world to the visually impaired. Drishti helps to read the text in front of the user, and it also conveys the environment around the visually impaired, by describing the objects and relationship b/w the objects.  Examples are a 'person sitting on a bench,' 'a dog is sleeping,' 'a stop sign on the road'. On users command the image is captured with a camera connected to the raspberry pi. If the user wants text description of the image, the image is analysed by Google's Cloud Vision API using Optical Character Recognition to detect the characters, letters in the picture, and if the user wants the scene description of the nearby environment, the image is sent to the Microsoft Cognitive Services to analyse the image using Computer Vision. Generated result is stored in the Dynamo DB (Cloud database). When the user asks Alexa to 'Read the text' or 'Explain the environment', the Alexa Skill Kit triggers AWS Lambda Function to fetch the results from the database (Dynamo Db). The Alexa app then recites the stored result on the user's mobile. This innovative device, designed to serve the visually impaired, is handy, easy to use with high accuracy.",

      "description": "The AIY Vision Kit is a handy hardware bundle created by Google, one of several projects aimed at Do-It-Yourself Artificial Intelligence (AIY = Artificial Intelligence Yourself). These kits are available at most computer hardware stores and online retailers in Dubai and contain all the hardware (including a Raspberry Pi with a camera and the Vision Bonnet, a custom board for computer vision) required to build a compact intelligent camera system in a few easy steps, before taking it for a spin on image and face recognition tasks.  In this workshop, we’ll do a deep dive into the AIY Vision Kit and the available libraries for it: learning how to use machine learning models, APIs and the assorted peripherals to create our own desktop focus checker. This smart system will process a variety of visual cues through a neural network to detect when our attention is slipping, a handy feature with the amount of on-camera work we do these days.

      "description": "Problem identified: In places such as cafes, shops, movie theatre, it's very difficult to collect review to know the performance quality by making them fill the form, it's very time consuming and sometimes confusing. According to recent research, 84% of people fill out at least one web form per week. Which supports our stance that most of the people prefer to review by saying it rather than filling any form. Solution: So to solve this problem and enhance communication, we have made this project that collects people’s review by asking them personally, and analyze whether the review is positive, negative or neutral and hence bridges the communication gap. So, in order to achieve this, we have used technologies such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion. On starting the program, a page designed using Tkinter (pythons GUI), opens up. On the click of the button, the program starts talking to the user, which makes it easier for the user to understand what to do, using text to speech. The person can then speak and record its review. The speech and text conversion were achieved using the libraries namely speech_recognition, pyttsx3, and gTTS. Note: You need to have these packages on your computer in order to run the program. Execute the following lines of code in your command prompt to install the packages. pip install speech_recognition pip install pyttsx3 (if this dows noot get installed, kindly install the .whl file for the corresponding library.) pip install gTTS speech_recognition: Recognizing speech requires audio input, and SpeechRecognition makes retrieving this input really easy. Instead of having to build scripts for accessing microphones and processing audio files from scratch, SpeechRecognition will have you up and running in just a few minutes. pyttsx3: is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translates' text-to-speech API textblob- Textblob and its NLPTK libraries. After recording the review from a customer, it analyses whether the review given is positive or negative or neutral, and to do this we have used textblob and its NLPTK libraries. And all the reviews are stored in a database called db.txt file for future reference. Recommendation: Run the code using the Visual Studio Code. Project Done By: Gaurav Vinod Bhambhani (18BCE072)",
